If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content.</p>



            <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, APPLICATION OR SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE, VIA THE APPLICATION OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE AND APPLICATION.

            <h3>Modification</h3>



            <p>Nicerr reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Site, Application or Services or to modify these Terms, including the Charity Support Fee (as defined below), at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or via the Application. Modifications to these Terms shall automatically be effective upon posting; provided, however, that material changes to the Terms will be effective as to an existing Member thirty (30) days after notice to the Member is provided via email from&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hello@nicerr.me">hello@nicerr.me</a>&nbsp;to your email address on file with Nicerr. You agree to keep your email address on file with Nicerr up-to-date. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services.</p>



            <h3>Eligibility</h3>



            <p>The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are aged 16 or older. Any access to or use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 16 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site, Application or Services you represent and warrant that (i) you agree to be bound by these Terms and (ii) that you are 16 or older and able to form legally binding contracts. However, if law&nbsp;requires that you must be older in order for Nicerr to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>



            <h3>How the Site, Application and Services Work</h3>



            <p>The Site is a platform for Members to connect and schedule Appointments in order to exchange information with other Members. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to use the Services or post a Listing, you must provide your contact information and other information the meeting request form deems mandatory.</p>



            <p>Nicerr’s role is solely to facilitate the availability of the Site, Application and Services and to provide services related thereto, such as Appointment scheduling, call queuing, call cycling, payment integration and call facilitation. Nicerr does not provide and is not responsible for Member Content or any information or advice exchanged between Members during Appointments or otherwise. Nicerr does not verify the credentials of any of its Members. You understand and acknowledge that Experts are not employees or agents of Nicerr but are independent service providers using the Site, Application and Services to market their expertise to other Members and the public. You acknowledge that Nicerr will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on information provided by Members or information contained in Member Content.</p>



            <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE MEMBER INTERACTION. NICERR CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL OR GUARANTEE THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS OR THE INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN MEMBERS VIA THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NICERR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED UNDER THE SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, ALL MEMBERS USE THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES AT THEIR OWN RISK.</p>



            <h3>Listings</h3>



            <p>You (as an Expert) may create Listings to offer your services to other Members. To this end, you may need to provide information regarding the expertise you offer as well as pricing and other financial terms applicable to your offering. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services.</p>



            <p>Seekers will be able to schedule an Appointment with you via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Seeker requests an Appointment, the price quoted under your Listing may not be altered.</p>



            <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the agreements you enter into with Seekers (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) comply with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to you and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Nicerr assumes no responsibility for the content of Listings or for any Member’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>



            <p>You understand and agree that Nicerr is not involved in the interactions between Members and does not refer or endorse or recommend particular Experts to Seekers. You also understand and acknowledge that Nicerr does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee Member Content or the content of communications between Members. As stated above, Nicerr is not party to any agreements entered into between Members.</p>



            <p>Nicerr reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Nicerr, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Expert, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.</p>



            <h3>No Endorsement</h3>



            <p>As stated above, Nicerr does not endorse any of its Members. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity or credentials. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site, Application and Services.</p>



            <p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Nicerr with respect to such actions or omissions.</p>



            <h3>Appointments and Financial Terms</h3>



            <p>Appointments and Financial Terms for Experts: When you confirm an Appointment request, Nicerr will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.</p>



            <p>The amount due and payable by a Seeker relating to Appointment time with you is referred to as an&nbsp;<strong>“Meeting Fee”</strong>. Meeting Fees are quoted in each Listing, in CAD dollars per 30 minute meetings. Please note that it is Experts, and not Nicerr, which set the Meeting Fee.</p>



            <p>In consideration of the Services, Nicerr charges you a fee (the&nbsp;<strong>“Charity Support Fee”</strong>) which is indicated on the Expert’s page. The Charity Support Fee is deducted from the Meeting Fee payable to the charity of the expert’s choice. At the conclusion of each Appointment, Nicerr calculates the appropriate. Except as otherwise provided herein, Charity Support Fees are non-refundable.</p>



            <p>Please note that Nicerr does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.</p>



            <p>Appointments and Financial Terms for Seekers</p>



            <p>You (as a Seeker), not Nicerr, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Appointments. If you choose to enter into a transaction with an Expert by scheduling an Appointment via the Site or Application, these Terms and other terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Appointment as set out in the Listing may apply. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Nicerr, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Nicerr is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.</p>



            <p>You agree to pay Nicerr the Meeting Fee due in connection with any Appointment. In order to initiate an Appointment, you understand and agree that Nicerr reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain a pre-authorization of your credit card or charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed five Canadian dollar ($5 CAD), in order to verify your credit card. Please note that Nicerr cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Member by his or her bank related to Nicerr’s collection of the Appointment Fees, and Nicerr disclaims all liability in this regard.</p>



            <p>In connection with your payment, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Nicerr or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Nicerr for any consummated Appointments in accordance with these Terms, by one of the methods described on the Site or Application. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the Appointment, either directly by Nicerr or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. If you are directed to Nicerr’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Appointment.</p>



            <h3>General Financial Terms</h3>



            <p>Refunds</p>



            <p>You (as a Seeker) may cancel an Appointment without penalty; provided, however, that you provide a notice up to 7 days before the scheduled meeting. You (as an Expert) may cancel a scheduled Appointment without penalty at any time. If you have been improperly charged for an Appointment that was cancelled and require a refund, please contact Nicerr at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hello@nicerr.me">hello@nicerr.me</a>.</p>



            <p>Taxes</p>



            <p>You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. Nicerr cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

            <h3>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h3>



            <p>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and Canada, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Calgary, Alberta for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</p>



            <h3>Severability</h3>



            <p>These Terms are intended to govern the agreement between Nicerr and you to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, for any reason or to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>



            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>



            <p>You and Nicerr agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration , except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Nicerr are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Nicerr otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>



            <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>



            <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Nicerr and you regarding the Site, Application, Services, Collective Content and any Appointments or Listings made via the Site, Application and Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Nicerr and you regarding the same.</p>



            <h3>General</h3>



            <p>The failure of Nicerr to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Nicerr. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>



            <h3>Contacting Nicerr</h3>



            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Nicerr at hello@nicerr.me</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. Please note that the Site and Application may contain links to other websites. If you click on a link to another website, this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information collected on that website. Nicerr is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of these other websites, and we recommend that you read the privacy policies of each website that you visit.</p>



            <p>As used in this policy, the terms&nbsp;<strong>“using”</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>“processing”</strong>&nbsp;information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within Canada or internationally.</p>



            <h3>The Collection of Information</h3>



            <p>Our principal goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (collectively, the&nbsp;<strong>“Service”</strong>) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application. The types of information that we collect include:</p>



            <p>Information you provide to us</p>



            <p><em>Personal Information:</em>&nbsp;You may browse the Site and Application without providing any personal information that may be used to identify you personally. However, when you request a meeting, access certain content or features, or directly contact the Site or Application, we may ask you to provide information, including:</p>



            <ul><li>your name, phone number, email address and postal address;</li><li>your username, password, and account setting preferences;</li><li>your credit card number, billing address and other billing related information.</li></ul>



            <p>(collectively,&nbsp;<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>) Information automatically collected When you visit and interact on the Site or Application, certain information is collected automatically, including:</p>



            <p><em>Non-Identifying Information:</em>&nbsp;We collect other non-identifying information you provide as part of the registration, administration and personalization of your Nicerr Account profile (e.g. account preferences) (<strong>“Non-Identifying Information”</strong>). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Nicerr Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site, Application and Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>



            <p><em>Log Data:</em>&nbsp;When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user (any of these, a&nbsp;<strong>“Nicerr User”</strong>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<strong>“Log Data”</strong>). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (<strong>“IP”</strong>) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors’ needs. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>



            <p><em>Cookies:</em>&nbsp;Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Nicerr Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site or Application and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the Service.</p>



            <p><em>Web Beacons:</em>&nbsp;Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our Member communications and marketing campaigns.</p>



            <ul><li>(c) Information collected from other sources</li></ul>



            <p>We may access information about you from third-party sources and platforms e.g. Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. As part of the functionality of the Site, Service and Application, you may link your Nicerr Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Nicerr through the Site, Service or Application; or (ii) allowing Nicerr to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Nicerr and/or grant Nicerr access to your Third Party Account for use for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Nicerr to pay any fees or making Nicerr subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable TPSP.</p>



            <p>If you register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable TPSP (such as your true name, email address, profile picture, names of TPSP friends, names of TPSP groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable TPSP and/or other information you authorize Nicerr to access by authorizing the TPSP to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Nicerr Account and Nicerr Account profile page. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the TPSP and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Nicerr Account on the Site, Service and Application. If there is information about your “friends” or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those “friends” or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable TPSP.</p>

            <h3>Third Party Services</h3>



            <p>To customize your experience on the Site and Application and to simplify our registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with TPSPs, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

            <p>Your Personal Information is password protected and our main servers are locked and hosted by a leading provider of Internet access to enterprises with mission-critical Internet application requirements. Access to the host environment is secure.</p>



            <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Nicerr. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Nicerr Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited email or telephone communication.</p>



            <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site and Application, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hello@nicerr.me">hello@nicerr.me</a>.</p>



            <p>Note that we will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site and Application in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>



            <h3>International Transfer</h3>



            <p>Nicerr and its third party partners to whom we disclose information under this policy may perform activities outside of the United States and potentially collect, transfer, store, and process your personal information in other countries. As a result, your information may be subject to the laws of those countries or other jurisdictions. These laws may not be equivalent to the privacy and data protection laws in your jurisdiction. Information may be disclosed in response to valid demands or requests from government authorities, courts, or law enforcement in these countries. By using the Site, Application or providing us with your information, you consent to the potential collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information in other countries.</p>
